# Leetcoding
Having 'fun' with some of the most famous Leetcode exercises. Reporting my reasoning and trials here for each exercise till I solve them all⚔️

## Neetcode 150. 

It has been a while since I started playing with Neetcode 150's list of exercises [**here**](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode150&subpage=practice). I solved more than 100 exercises, then I decided to report them here on github for 2 main reasons:

1. at the end of the day I'm programming and, unless I'm doing it for my job, I like to share here what I write in form of code;
2. for every exercise I solve, there's a reasoning path and a lot of mistakes behind it (I also admit that most of the times I follow the video solution to really understand it). Thus, I decided to report here every exercise (repeated again) so that I can add more comments and versions while keeping them, it could be useful to go through it again in the future.

Moreover, this will probably help me being consistent, I hope to conclude the entire list (with all the exercises repeated and fully understood) by the end of March 2026. If you enter here later and see there are less than 151 files, blame me in some way, thank you.
